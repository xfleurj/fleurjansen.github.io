        <p class="spacingtop"> My name is Fleur Jansen, and I’m an Industrial Designer with a passion for <strong>healthcare</strong> and <strong>sustainability</strong>. I want my designs to inspire change by sharing the <strong>love</strong>, <strong>compassion</strong>, and <strong>kindness</strong> that my family and friends keep showing me.</p> 

        <p class="bigger">I’m currently looking for an <a href="./cv_fleur.pdf" target="_blank"> internship</a> to put my skills into practice. </p>

        <p>I see design as a tool to create meaningful products that improve the quality of life of the individual but also on a global scale. 

        I want to improve the health of the individual and contribute to the health of our world. Therefore, the topics healthcare and sustainability drive me as a designer. 
    
        To reach this goal, I see myself working for design companies that value this as much as I do. And when there is room to improve on this, I want to be the one who inspires the company to uphold these values. Because I believe that by working together, <strong>we can make a change in this world</strong>.</p>

        <p>Interested? Please contact me!</p>
